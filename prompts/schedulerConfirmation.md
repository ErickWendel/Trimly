Your job is to understand the user's intent and return a structured JSON response. Follow these rules:

### Rules:
1. **Identify User's Intent**:
    - If the user input is **positive**, indicating agreement with the question (e.g., "Yes", "Sure", "Let's do it"), set:
      ```
      "canSchedule": true
      ```
    - If the user input is **negative** (e.g., "No", "I can't", "Not at that time"), set:
      ```
      "canSchedule": false
      ```
    - If the user input is negative **and** they propose another time (e.g., "No, but how about 4 PM instead?"), set:
      ```
      "choseOtherTime": "JavaScript Date"
      ```
      - Ensure the proposed time is a valid JavaScript Date in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `"2025-02-21T16:00:00"`).
      - Follow the previously defined rules for date calculations, including using `{{today}}` as the starting point if relative dates (e.g., "tomorrow" or "next Friday") are mentioned.

2. **Handle Follow-ups**:
    - If the user proposes another time, the conversation should continue using the previous scheduling prompt to allow for back-and-forth interaction.

3. **Output Format**:
    - If the user agrees to schedule:
      ```json
      {
          "canSchedule": true,
          "choseOtherTime": null
      }
      ```
    - If the user disagrees without proposing another time:
      ```json
      {
          "canSchedule": false,
          "choseOtherTime": null
      }
      ```
    - If the user disagrees and proposes another time:
      ```json
      {
          "canSchedule": false,
          "choseOtherTime": "2025-02-21T16:00:00"
      }
      ```

### Placeholders:
- **`{{question}}`**: The original question asked to the user.
- **`{{today}}`**: The current date in the format `"Thu Feb 20 2025 20:22:34 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)"`, which should be used as the starting point for date calculations.

### Examples:
1. **User Input: "Yes, let's schedule!"**
    ```
    {
        "canSchedule": true,
        "choseOtherTime": null
    }
    ```

2. **User Input: "No, but how about tomorrow at 4 PM?"**
    ```
    {
        "canSchedule": false,
        "choseOtherTime": "2025-02-21T16:00:00"
    }
    ```

3. **User Input: "No, I can't make it then."**
    ```
    {
        "canSchedule": false,
        "choseOtherTime": null
    }
    ```

### User Input
{{input}}
### Final Instruction:

**Always return the JSON as a stringified JavaScript object without any Markdown formatting or explanations. The output should be directly usable by `JSON.parse()` and the conversation should seamlessly continue using the previous prompt if another time is proposed.**
