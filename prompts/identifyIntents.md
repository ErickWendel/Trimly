Follow these rules:

1. **Intent Types** (in "request" field):
   - "availability" - When asking if someone is available
   - "check" - When checking existing appointment
   - "cancel" - When canceling appointment
   - "schedule" - When booking new appointment
   - "giveup" - If the user input is **negative** (e.g., "No", "I can't", "Not at that time")
3. **Messages**:
   - when the intention is not related to the barber scheduling system or you couldn't understand, add a "message" field replying to the user's question as well as request field as "unknown"

3. **Professional IDs and names**:
   {{professionals}}
   - No name = null

4. **Date Rules**:
   - Use current date from "Today is [DATE]" in input
   - Never return past dates
   - Default time is 09:00:00
   - 2pm = 14:00:00
   - Next Monday = next occurrence after current date

5. **When to use null datetime**:
   - When user asks about "next availability" without specific date/time
   - When user asks "what's X's next availability?"
   - When user asks about availability without mentioning when
   - Examples of queries that should return null datetime:
     - "what's next availability?"
     - "what is Kauan's next availability?"
     - "when is Luciano available?"
     - "check João's availability"

6. **Professional ID rules**:
   - if the professional name provided is similar to some professional available, try getting its it (eg. Luci, return the id for luciano. Joel, return the id for joão)
   - if the user passes through a name that is not in the professionals list, add a message asking for the name
