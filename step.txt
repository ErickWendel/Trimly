* Mock data for the barber service
starts at 9:00 (540 minutes), skips lunch from 12:00 to 13:00, and ends at 17:30 (so they finish by 18:00). 
All three professionals are available in each 30-minute slot, and service_time remains 40

The schedule property is the minutes since midnight, so 540 is 9:00, 600 is 10:00, 630 is 10:30, etc.
